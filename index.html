        MENACE (or Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine) is one of the first reinforcement learning engines, and it was built to play Tic Tac Toe. It works by having a series of matchboxes, with each matchbox corresponding to a game state. Each matchbox contains some beads of different colors, and each bead represents a different move. MENACE works by choosing a random bead out of a matchbox that determines its next move. At the end of a game, MENACE will update the weights of the matchboxes corresponding to the game states it saw based on the outcome of the game.
