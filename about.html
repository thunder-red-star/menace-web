    <p class="description m-auto max-w-screen-lg text-l">
        This app serves as a computer-based simulation of MENACE, so one doesn't have to obtain 700 matchboxes, or play
        hundreds of games manually, to understand how MENACE works. Provided are pages to play your games against a
        MENACE-style AI, a page to train MENACE against itself (faster than playing games against it manually), a page
        to load a preset weighting for MENACE's "matchboxes", and a page to analyze MENACE's weightings and view graphs,
        as well as dump weightings.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="description m-auto max-w-screen-lg text-l">
        This app uses your LocalStorage as a database, so if you exit the page, your weightings will be saved. However,
        on the train page, you can clear your weightings, so you can train against a new set of games.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="description m-auto max-w-screen-lg text-l">
        On the training page, you can configure how MENACE trains itself. Many configuration variables are available,
        including rewards/punishments, initial weights, and more.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="description m-auto max-w-screen-lg text-l">
        This version of MENACE is meant to be more versatile than the original, being able to play both X and O.
        However, the concepts of "matchboxes" determining moves is still the same -- there are just more matchboxes.
